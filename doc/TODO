Planned
=======

Finish makesnapshots.pl. :)

Make all binaries to change their eUID, as we don't want them to be
runned as root when root calls it: it's a bit insecure and can lead to
tons of real shit.

Make MonkeyMan able to cache object's information in memory, just simulating
loading to the script. There should be handles to control its behaviour by
configuration options



Implemented
===========

Also consider the developement branch, as every time you're breaking
something, a lots of things just can't work!
